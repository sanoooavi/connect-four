# Connect4 Game

This project is a Connect4 game developed as part of an AI course project. The game is implemented in Python using the Pygame library.

## Game Description

Connect4 is a two-player strategy game where the objective is to connect four of your own colored discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does. The game is played on a grid with 6 rows and 7 columns.

## Features

- Player vs. Player: Play against a friend locally.
- Player vs. AI: Test your skills against an AI opponent.
- Interactive GUI: The game features an intuitive graphical user interface built with Pygame.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the Pygame library by running the following command:
   ````
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
4. Navigate to the project directory.
5. Run the following command to start the game:
   ````
   python main.py
   ```

## Controls

- Use the left and right arrow keys to move the cursor.
- Press the spacebar to drop a disc in the selected column.

## Acknowledgments

- The game logic and AI algorithms were developed based on the concepts learned in the AI course.
- The Pygame library was used for creating the graphical user interface.
